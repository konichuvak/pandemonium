class EligibilityTrace:
    r""" Base class for various eligibility traces in :math:`\TD` learners.

    Eligibility trace is a mechanism for a short-term memory,
    mathematically represented as a vector, $e_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$,
    that parallels the long-term weight vector $w_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$.

    The rough intuition is that when a component of $w_t$ participates in
    producing an estimated value, then the corresponding component of $e_t$
    is bumped up and then begins to fade away. Learning will then occur in
    that component of $w_t$ if a nonzero $\TD$ error occurs before the trace
    falls back to zero.

    The trace-decay parameter $\lambda \mapsto [0, 1]$ determines the rate
    at which the trace falls.
