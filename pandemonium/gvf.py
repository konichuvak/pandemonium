class GVF:
    r""" **General Value Function**

    Consider a stream of data $\{ (x_t, A_t) \}^{\infty}_{t=0}$, produced
    by agent-environment interaction. Here, $x$ is a tensor of experience
    (see :class:`pandemonium.experience.Transition`) and $A$ is an action
    from a finite action space $\mathcal{A}$.

    The target $G$ is a summary of the future value of the cumulant
    $Z$, discounted according to the termination function $\gamma$:

    .. math::
        G_t = Z_{t+1} + \sum_{\tau=t+1}^{\infty} \gamma_{\tau} Z_{\tau+1}

    GVF estimates the expected value of the target cumulant,
    given actions are generated according to the target policy:

    .. math::
        \mathbb{E}_π [G_t|S_t = s]

    To make things more concrete, keep in mind an example of predicting a
    robot’s light sensor as it drives around a room. We will stick to this
    example throughout definitions in this abstract class.

    .. note::
        The value produced is not necessarily scalar, i.e. in case of estimating
        an action-function(Q) we get a row vector with values corresponding to
        each possible action.
