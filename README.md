# Pand√¶monium

Predictive knowledge acquisition via hierarchical reinforcement learning.
This library provides implementations for agents that seek to learn about
their environment by predicting multiple signals from a single stream of
experience. 

This project is inspired by [Adam White's](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/) 
PhD work on learning predictive knowledge representations.
